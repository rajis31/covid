                            This platform is built by patients ‚Äî for patients ‚Äî
                            to spotlight a truth many have forgotten: Long COVID
                            is still here, and it‚Äôs devastating lives. Even
                            though the pandemic has been declared ‚Äúover,‚Äù
                            millions of people are still fighting every day to
                            function, to be heard, and to heal. I know this
                            because I‚Äôm one of them. After becoming infected in
                            January 2025, I was hit with Long COVID ‚Äî and it
                            changed everything. The symptoms are not just
                            lingering; they are life-altering. I created this
                            space so people like me ‚Äî and people like you ‚Äî can
                            share their stories, connect, and be part of
                            something bigger. Because behind every number is a
                            person struggling to be understood. The urgency is
                            real. While research is underway, we need answers
                            faster. We need a cure. In the U.S. alone, an
                            estimated 5% of the population is still living with
                            Long COVID ‚Äî including over 6 million children,
                            making it the most common chronic illness in kids
                            today. That‚Äôs not a footnote. That‚Äôs a national
                            emergency. Let‚Äôs make sure the world doesn‚Äôt move on
                            without us.
